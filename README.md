# Python-Text-Adventure
Project done for independent study class to make up a single credit from a previous python class that was removed from the curriculm.

The project's focus was on a object oriented structure for the way scenes are created and saved as individual files as children from the parent class with defaults for certain methods. This allows for each scene to handle it's own description and other variables based on player input as well as what kind of items it may contain.
